# Folder-Structure-Viewer Project (Front-End)
## I've tried building this folder-structure viewer front-end with Vite + React, I couldn't finish the project on time due to limited time and not having the practice of backend development for sometime now. However even after the time is finished I'll try to finish this project as it seems like  a fun little app and I'm getting to learn quite a lot by working on this project.

# To run this project clone the project first then use npm install to install necessary dependencies then run the `npm run dev` script in the terminal, just type `npm run dev` and hit enter, the script will take care of the rest.


## Then head on to http://localhost:5173/ to see the local version of the app.
